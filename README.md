A Tale of Two Test Suites
=========================

WordPress, API Mocking, and Integrations

Summary
-------

[WordPress](https://wordpress.org) powers over 20% of the Internet and comes with a fully-fleshed out unit testing framework covering the core library. For testing plugins and themes (extensions to WordPress), I developed [WP_Mock](https://github.com/10up/wp_mock), a comprehensive mocking framework for WordPress. WP_Mock allows developers to test their code in complete isolation from WordPress itself.

This presentation walks viewers through both test frameworks, covering the pros/cons of each and examples of their use. Even non-WordPress developers will gain a further understanding of PHPUnit, unit testing in general, process isolation, and code modularization.
