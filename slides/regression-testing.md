<ul>
    <li class="fragment">Customers <i>will</i> report bugs in your application</li>
    <li class="fragment">A large development team <i>will</i> re-introduce fixed bugs</li>
    <li class="fragment">Tests can help ensure these bugs don't derail your project</li>
</ul>

note:
    Automated unit tests help ensure that bugs don't reappear as you're developing an application.
