##  Implementation

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">Keep your test goals in mind</li>
    <li class="fragment">The Core framework is for integration testing</li>
    <li class="fragment">The mocking framework is for unit testing</li>
    <li class="fragment">Ultimately, both are free...</li>
</ul>

note:
    Always keep in mind the final goals with which you started testing: What are we testing? Why are we testing it? What will a failing test tell us?
