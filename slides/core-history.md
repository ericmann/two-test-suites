    <li class="fragment">Originally by Nikolay Bachiyski in 2011</li>
    <li class="fragment">Officially adopted in 2012 ([Test Trac #42](https://unit-tests.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42))</li>
</ul>

note:
    The core test framework started as an external project, became a sister project to WordPress itself, and was eventually rolled in to the core development suite itself.
