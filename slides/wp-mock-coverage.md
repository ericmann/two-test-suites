##  WP_Mock: Coverage

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">APIs are not available unless you define them</li>
    <li class="fragment">No external services/integrations are used</li>
    <li class="fragment">Every class/namespace can be tested separately</li>
</ul>

note:
    The point of the mocking framework is to test your code in isolation from the environment in which it runs - you have to define your dependencies explicitly.
